\section{Conclusion}
 Minimum spanning tree algorithms have been researched for a long time since 1926 and widely applications have made it an important research fields. However, for large data sets, the efficiency of computing the distance between point pairs is very low. To alleviate this problem, we present a new efficient approximate MST constructing method based on sampling. Experiment results show the good performance for our method. In the future, we will improve our method to the high-dimensional data sets that cannot be put into memory at one time.
