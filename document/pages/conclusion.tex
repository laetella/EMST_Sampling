\section{Conclusion}
	Traditional minimum spanning tree-based clustering algorithm only consider the real distance between two points, which have many problems when removing the inconsistent edges. To address this issue, This paper presents a new method to compute MST and MST-based clustering. It works by considering the scaled edge in MST. Scaled means that we use the distance between two points divide the weight of the last edge added to the MST to identify the inconsistent edges. Furthermore, in order to improve the performance of MST-based clustering, every time we get a new cluster, we remove the points in this cluster so that we can largely reduce our source data.   

	Our contribution is not only improving the quality of the result of clustering,  but also reducing the time complexity of large image data. We apply our Scaled-MST-based clustering algorithm to high dimension image data. Image segmentation and integration is analysis in this paper. To some extent, we improve the performance of computation of new object recognition. Our experimental results show that the proposed method is useful and effective.
