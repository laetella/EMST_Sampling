		Clustering analysis is an important technique in the field of data mining. Nowadays, minimum spanning tree-based clustering is becoming one of the most widely used clustering techniques. Although MST-based clustering has been researched for a long time, the requirements of high execution efficiency and high accuracy of clustering result cannot be met at the same time. After analyzing the advantages and disadvantages of the traditional MST-based clustering algorithm, this paper presents a new method to improve the traditional clustering algorithm. There are two steps of our method. Firstly, we use scaled edge weight to compute a scaled-MST. Secondly, we cluster the data set according to the scaled-MST we compute in the first step. Furthermore, we apply our algorithm on image integration. Experiments performed on both small data sets and high-dimensional data sets demonstrate the efficacy of our method.
