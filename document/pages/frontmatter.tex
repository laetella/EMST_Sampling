		Euclidean Minimum Spanning Tree algorithm is an important method in many fields, and abundant developments have made it a significant branch of mordern graph-based algorithms. However, for today's real-world high dimensionality and huge size data sets, the efficiency of these algorithms is the major bottleneck. To address this issue, this paper presents a new method for MST using sampling. In the first step, we sampling from the data sets by using nearest neighbours to reduce the scale and construct an MST. Then we insert the remainned data to the MST. Experiment results demonstrate the efficacy of our method on high dimensional data sets.
